          The idea of using food and therapeutic nutrients as medical therapy is a well-established practice, grounded in science and experiencing a burgeoning movement brought about by practitioners and patients seeking improved, more advanced and more personalized care with longer lasting results. Functional Medicine is the term used to describe the approach that has captured the attention of not just a more naturalistic breed of physician or veterinarian, but many in the greater medical community. “Functional Medicine really is a root cause approach to chronic disease,” says Dr. Nate Bergman of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, a leading institution in the science and practice of using food to heal. “Rather than trying to fit the patient into a diagnostic box, instead we are more interested in understanding, ‘why is this person not feeling well or why are they not performing optimally? What are the perturbations on a fundamental level?’ It’s the questions of why,” he explains. Dr. Bergman and his colleagues are at the forefront of redefining what is possible in preventing and treating chronic disease with less reliance on pharmaceuticals, and in many cases, no reliance at all. It’s no coincidence that the movement has taken hold in veterinary medicine as well, with researchers and practitioners realizing the impact of a more ‘natural’ approach to care not simply due to strong anecdotal evidence, but thanks to convincing science and ever-evolving hard data. “Over the past few decades veterinarians and horse owners have come to realize the importance of nutrition in helping to maintain health and prolong life in horses,” says Dr. Cliff Honnas of Texas Equine Hospital. “Trends from human medicine have shifted focus away from pharmacotherapy-derived medical care and toward more ‘natural’ means of maintaining health.”
